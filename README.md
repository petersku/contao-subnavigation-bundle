# Contao Subnavigation Bundle

This bundle shows the direkt sub-menuitems of the active page in an easy and lightwight way.

## Why

Instead of outputting the entire navigation, we only wanted to output the direct sub-items of the current page. 

Hiding of the elements that are not required via CSS is no longer necessary. 

## How

Create a new module of type "Dynamic Subnavigation" (Category = Navigation).

Embed the module in the layout theme.
